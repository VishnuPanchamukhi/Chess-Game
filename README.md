# Chess-Game

This is a 2D chess game developed in Python using the Pygame module. The game allows a player to compete against a bot, which uses a Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning along with a static evaluation function to determine its moves. The GUI is inspired by the design of Chess.com.
