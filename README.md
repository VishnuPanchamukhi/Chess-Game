# Chess-Game

This is a 2D chess game developed in Python using the Pygame module. The game allows a player to compete against a bot in a timed game, which uses a Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning along with a static evaluation function to determine its moves. The GUI is inspired by the design of Chess.com.
In order to optimise the bot, move ordering, and quiescence search have also been implemented in order to make the minimax algorithm more efficient, and to avoid the "horizon effect".
